# Longest-Common-Substring
Longest Common Substring in C, second year second semester's third Algorithms project (partial)

A C-language modular program that addresses the problem of finding a LCS (Longest Common Substring) using dynamic programming.

#### Input:
1) Two positive integers (**m**, **n**) that are variables that describe the sizes of two
Series **X** and **Y**
2) Series **X** with **m** elements (this vector is represented by a dynamic array)
3) Series **Y** with **n** elements (this vector is represented by a dynamic array)

#### Output:
1) Table **c**
2) Table **b**
3) LCS of the two given series

#### Assumption:
The alphabet is the English alphabet
